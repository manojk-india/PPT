What Problem Have We Identified?
ðŸ”´ Manual Dependency on Scrum Masters' Dashboards

Managers rely on Scrum Masters to extract and interpret team performance data.

This process is time-consuming, manual, and prone to delays.

ðŸ”´ Lack of Real-Time Visibility

No direct way for managers to access real-time team performance insights.

Delayed reports lead to slower decision-making.

ðŸ”´ Scattered Information Across Jira and Confluence

Data is fragmented across multiple Jira boards and Confluence pages.

Requires manual effort to consolidate, analyze, and interpret data.

ðŸ”´ Jira Hygiene and Backlog Management Issues

Teams struggle with messy backlogs, leading to inefficiencies in sprint planning.

Ensuring backlog health requires continuous monitoring and manual intervention.

ðŸ”´ Inefficient Capacity Utilization

Without clear workload insights, overloading or underutilization of team members occurs.

Hard to predict bottlenecks and balance resources effectively.
